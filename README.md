- 👋 Hi, I’m @MachinePy
- 👀 I’m interested in HDL coding and hardware designs like CPU, NPU, GPGPU, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all kinds of HDL such as SystemVerilog, VHDL, and Chisel, ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a new HDL "MachinePy" that will combine all the excellent HDL advanatages
- 📫 How to reach me:
- [EMAIL]machinepy@zohomail.com
- [GIT]MachinePy
- 😄 Pronouns: All In AI. AI helps people.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Chisel is good, HOWEVER, the generated code is literally trash.
